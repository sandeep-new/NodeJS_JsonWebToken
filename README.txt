I have used JSON WEB TOKEN Package for request authentication
I have created 2 differen servers,
One for only generating token, refresh token after every minute (at port 6000)
Another for (port 5000) tooken authentication
I used request.rest functionality to test, we can also do the same with postman
.env is to hold some secret information
